# Macronutrient Calculator

## Description
This app is a simple calculator that takes sex, weight, body fat, and activity level from the user and calculates the following:
* Lean Body Mass (LBM)
* Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)
* Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)
* Daily Caloric Intake for Weight Loss
* Macronutrient Targets
    * Protein
    * Fat
    * Carbohydrates

Macronutrient amounts will be given an upper and lower range that will vary based on the body fat percentage and the proportion of calories from fat.
